# All entries in this config are converted to usable placeholders
# The format will be as such, assuming "item_armor_total" as key:
# $lapi_item_armor_total$
# AND
# $lapi_list_item_armor_total$
#
# The difference between these two placeholders is that the first will simply inject a value
# into the single line in the lore, even the attribute is not present on the item.
# The benefit of this is that you may use several of these placeholders in one line, since they are
# simple string placeholders. The downside is that it will be extra work maintaining formats
# for items that may or may not have the relevant attribute, which would make it pointless to display.
#
# The second placeholder injects a line matching the format in place of its presence, if present.
# The benefit of this is that this can be used to somewhat automatically add these placeholders
# to items to display stats, or not display them if they don't have them.
# The downside is that you can only use one per line.

# All the defined placeholders will only be able to change with their own, and equipped item stats.
# Things like potion effects or enchantments will not affect the displayed value

hide_flag: true # If true, the item will have a HIDE_ATTRIBUTES flag added as well, so the vanilla flags don't show up
